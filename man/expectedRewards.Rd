\title{Expected Rewards for a markovchain}
\usage{
expectedRewards(markovchain,n,rewards)
}
\arguments{
\item{markovchain}{the markovchain-class object}

\item{n}{no of steps of the process}

\item{rewards}{vector depicting rewards coressponding to states}
}
\value{
returns a vector of expected rewards for diffrent initial states
}
\description{
The function returns the value of expected rewards given 
rewards coressponding to every state
}
\details{
the function uses a dynamic programming to solve a recursive equation
described in reference.

\examples{
transMatr<-matrix(c(0.99,0.01,0.01,0.99),nrow=2,byrow=TRUE)
simpleMc<-new("markovchain", states=c("a","b"),
             transitionMatrix=transMatr)
expectedRewards(simpleMc,1,c(0,1))
