* Improves performance and refactors `communicatingClasses`, `recurrentClasses`, `transientStates`, `is.irreducible`, `canonicForm`, `summary` and `steadyStates` methods, porting them to C++ whenever possible and improving the algorithmic complexity of the code.
* Solves a bug with `steadyStates` method.
* Adds the methods `recurrentStates` and `transientClasses`.
* Makes the aforementioned methods work on by column Markov chains.
* Improves tests, adding checking of mathematical structural properties and hundreds of random test cases.
* Fixes documentation for `roxygen` and NAMESPACE file for automatic generation using `devtools::document()`
* Bumps Ignacio Cord√≥n as author (ORCID included)
